# RecipePage
 
This is the very beginning of my coding journey.  I had to make this page to showcase everything that i have learned over the past 2 weeks.  

I made this website 4 times - each time trying a different approach. Grid, Flex, Bootstrap and then finally ive got this final version.  So my commits will be in a very short time period but the total time it took me to make the website (including the 3 other attemps) was 2 weeks.
